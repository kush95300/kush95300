### Hey 👋
I'm <b> Kaushal Soni</b>

Being born and brought up in India Hindi was my First Language. My Grandfather named me Kaushal.

As Kaushal ( a Hindi word) stands for Skills, I am always curious about learning new skills and conserve my little time to polish my old skills. From my school, I was always among the Top rankers and unique thinkers. I love to work in a team to achieve our goal, whether it was a Volleyball Match, Team Quizzes, or a project.

👉 Fun Fact: Computer Science which I hate most (because I don't know about it), now it is the one which I never want to leave.

👉 I love to dig into Customer Problems and solve them with the latest technology. I scale, automate and optimize their products with my problem-solving skills. To accomplish the results I focus on team building, skill requirement, work assignment, and multiple checking process.

👉 If you want to know me in few words then,  I am an introspective, value-oriented, inspiring, skillful, social, and extremely expressive person.

If I focus on my skills then these are as follows: 

◆ Professional Skills
MlOps || DevOps || Programming Skills || Cloud Computing || Automation || DSA

◆ Soft Skills
Teamwork || Problem-solving || Critical-thinking || Decision-Making || Communication

◆ Technical Tools
Ansible || Jenkins || Git || GitHub || Kubernetes || aws || Redhat  || Docker|| Jupyter Notebook|| Flutter || Hadoop || C || C++ || Python
