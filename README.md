# About me <img src="about.gif" width="50px">
Being born and brought up in India Hindi was my First Language. My Grandfather named me Kaushal.

As Kaushal ( a Hindi word) stands for Skills, I am always curious about learning new skills and conserve my little time to polish my old skills. From my school, I was always among the Top rankers and unique thinkers. I love to work in a team to achieve our goal, whether it was a Volleyball Match, Team Quizzes, or a project.

**👉 Fun Fact:** *Computer Science which I hate most (because I don't know about it), now it is the one which I never want to leave.*

👉 *I love to dig into Customer Problems and solve them with the latest technology. I scale, automate and optimize their products with my problem-solving skills. To accomplish the results I focus on team building, skill requirement, work assignment, and multiple checking process.*

👉 *If you want to know me in few words then,  I am an introspective, value-oriented, inspiring, skillful, social, and extremely expressive person.*

If I focus on my skills then these are as follows: 

### ◆ Professional Skills
MlOps || DevOps || Programming Skills || Cloud Computing || Automation || DSA

### ◆ Soft Skills
Teamwork || Problem-solving || Critical-thinking || Decision-Making || Communication

### ◆ Technical Tools
Ansible || Jenkins || Git || GitHub || Kubernetes || aws || Redhat  || Docker|| Jupyter Notebook|| Flutter || Hadoop || C || C++ || Python
